game:
* blackout screen when falling
4 night, stars skybox
	* could be faked by just black or dark green (?) color
1 x-rope bridge + collisions

	* add poles
	* make player smaller, bridge "longer"
	* refine the canyon collisions
	* not in blender, procedural generation for resizing

	* can create a longer, straight bridge and shorten the distance between sides immediately
	* make poles higher


2 hearable voidy sound of vacuum or smth (fmod)
	# breath loudness peaks in the middle of the bridge
	# wind howling

3 callision callback triggering character breathing when stepping over the bridge
	* player starts in the cave and gets his voice louder as he enters the ledge
# shadow mapping
	# light, sea-blue, sunlit tops
	# black void beneath


# make blender rock nicer
	# refine blender models using mesh effects to make it look more like rock
	# make canyon bend properly so the end is not visible
	# plug the holes in it
+ add poles

* when you cross the bridge the atmosphere gradually changes to ligher
	* initially dark, preferably with some volumetric 
	* the change happens only on the last steps
	* skybox change  to stars on the blue
	* rock color change
	* shader change
	* music change
	* bridge breakes 
 (this idea is perfect for application to TGC)

# shader that makes bridge disapper hen player is on the ledge and appear when he steps on it. the poles indicate that there is a bridge

# add poles


clip + readme:
* video of subsequent stages
* clip: blender tool demnostration on first version

problems with phyisics:
	* try to implement basic constraints in physics demo: it seems to work there
	* try just changing my old bridge towards more complicated rope-bridge
		* change hinges for spring 6dofs 
		* make top joints from positions of blender-placed planks
