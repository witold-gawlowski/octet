	* add poles
	* make player smaller, bridge "longer"
	* refine the canyon collisions
	* not in blender, procedural generation for resizing

	* can create a longer, straight bridge and shorten the distance between sides immediately
	* make poles higher


2 hearable voidy sound of vacuum or smth (fmod)
	# breath loudness peaks in the middle of the bridge
3 callision callback triggering character breathing when stepping over the bridge
	* player starts in the cave and gets his voice louder as he enters the ledge
# shadow mapping
	# light, sea-blue, sunlit tops
	# black void beneath

# shader that makes bridge disapper hen player is on the ledge and appear when he steps on it. the poles indicate that there is a bridge

# add poles
