o basically block-moving game + gas puzzle
o View form the top, movable blocks 
* level of gas influences the health decrease
* Fluid Gas (color crucial)
* Shader for shading the space from character perspective 
* Compute shaders to speed up 
* i can add shadow shader if i have to or there is no time for compute
* walking with single point of a grid which is white and flashes when dead
* boxes have white outlines
* boxes hide the boundary texels
* count percentile of closed field
* count amount of fluid on our side
* level creator
* subsequent levels + score
* timer + countdown: level ends when time is over or when you die
* one level, no editor
* export all parameters in the begining of the code
* player gets defence as circle anround him
===============================================
game:
# use bfs to count percentile of map defended
+ health
* player targets at saving the most of area  from being poluted:
	-this target is important as it makes player enclose not only fluid,
	 but also early poluted ares of the map
+ some randomized boxes not moving, with different texture
+ randomized levels
* countdown
# export all parameters to the beginning of the code
+ smoothly moving around the player
* displaying score, lab secured, and game over
# move boxes and player code from mesh
# make the code nicely structured for marks and for me for later change
# set window not resizable
# create some music yo
# use fmod for sounds
# score bar on the left side: max score = whole area* no pollution


clip:
* movie with subsequent stages of work (thx to commits)
* years of wars in the bg ;)
==================================================
* bug-feature: pushing the box creates a safe space from gas behind it :D
* game end when there is no path from player to source, score screen:
	- bonus time
	- pollution
	- area 
	- total score:
* make the surrounding writings that describe what to do...
* refine edges so its clear where is the leak
