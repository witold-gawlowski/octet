o basically block-moving game + gas puzzle
o View form the top, movable blocks 
* level of gas influences the health decrease
* Fluid Gas (color crucial)
* Shader for shading the space from character perspective 
* Compute shaders to speed up 
* i can add shadow shader if i have to or there is no time for compute
* walking with single point of a grid which is white and flashes when dead
* boxes have white outlines
* boxes hide the boundary texels
* movie with subsequent stages of work (thx to commits)
* years of wars as ST for demo ;)
* use bfs to count percentile of map defended
* count percentile of closed field
* count amount of fluid on our side
* player targets at saving the most of area  from being poluted:
	-this target is important as it makes player enclose not only fluid,
	 but also early poluted ares of the map
* level creator
* subsequent levels + score
* timer + countdown: level ends when time is over or when you die
* one level, no editor
* export all parameters in the begining of the code
* health is lost acoording to level of pollution
* "lab secured" text when level complete
* "leak detected" when the source is closed but the wall is not wide enough (thinner than 1) and the level of the gass increases
* health is enough to make some pushing throught the gass
* randomized size and
* pickupable scafander that protects from fluid and lasts seconds
