o basically block-moving game + gas puzzle
o View form the top, movable blocks 
* level of gas influences the health decrease
* Fluid Gas (color crucial)
* Shader for shading the space from character perspective 
* Compute shaders to speed up 
* i can add shadow shader if i have to or there is no time for compute
* walking with single point of a grid which is white and flashes when dead
* boxes have white outlines
* boxes hide the boundary texels
* count percentile of closed field
* count amount of fluid on our side
* level creator
* subsequent levels + score
* timer + countdown: level ends when time is over or when you die
* one level, no editor
* export all parameters in the begining of the code
* player gets defence as circle anround him
===============================================
game:
+ use dfs to count percentile of map defended
+ health
+ player targets at saving the most of area  from being poluted:
	-this target is important as it makes player enclose not only fluid,
	 but also early poluted ares of the map
+ some randomized boxes not moving, with different texture
+ randomized levels
* countdown

+ smoothly moving around the player
+ displaying score, lab secured, and game over
+ score bar on the left side: max score = whole area* no pollution

==================================================
clip:
* movie with subsequent stages of work (thx to commits)
* years of wars in the bg ;)
game:
o bug-feature: pushing the box creates a safe space from gas behind it :D
o game end when there is no path from player to source, score screen:
	- bonus time
	- polution
	- area 
	- total score:
+ refine edges so its clear where is the leak
+ add sqrt to score
+ repair: score does not take into account space taken by boxes
+ hold alt to see leaked path and pause
# add tab for help:
	- you are in a room being filled with deadly gas, move boxes to stop it from spreading!
	- score: sqrt(defended area / (pollution + 1))
	- arrows to move
	- alt for showing a leak and pausing
	- backspace for restart
	- healthbar right
	- score bar left
	- score appears only when you defended
	- tell about leaky edges
* export all parameters to the beginning of the code
* move boxes and player code from the mesh code
* make the code nicely structured for marks and for me for later change
* set window not resizable
+ remove the bug with boxes randomizing at players position
* make some chiptune msc
* use fmod for sounds

# add bg image
	- add score scale on the bg img
		* logarithmic scale
	- caption: "hold tab for help" 
	# add my highscore note at the side ;)
+ add restart button
* remove memory leaks

==========================================================
* deliver
